### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jevil.  
I like making software, mostly for my personal use.  
I make it public just in case it helps out someone else as well.

Programming languages I know (somewhat):
- C#
- Visual Basic
- Python
- HTML
- CSS 
 
(Honestly I just tend to look up something I don't know)  
You can find out where to contact me on this site: https://jevil7452.neocities.org/contact
